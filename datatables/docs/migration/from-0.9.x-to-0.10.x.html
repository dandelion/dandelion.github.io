<h2 class="page-title">Migrating from 0.9.x to 0.10.x</h2>
<p>
   As with the previous release, much has changed. You will find below as exhaustive a list as possible of all changes.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Configuration properties</h3>
<p>
   Almost all the internal configuration has been refactored. As a consequence, if you were
   previously using a custom <code>datatables.properties</code> file, please update it following the <a
      href="/datatables/docs/ref/configuration/">configuration reference</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">JSP taglib</h3>
<p>Some attributes have been renamed for better consistency, while others have been removed or added.</p>
<p>You will find below all renamed and removed attributes. Please see the <a href="/datatables/releases/0.10.0/">change log of the v0.10.0</a> for the added attributes.</p>
<p>
   Renamed attributes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>filter => filterable</li>
   <li>sort => sortable</li>
   <li>paginate => pageable</li>
   <li>sortInit => sortInitDirection</li>
</ul>
<p>
   Removed attributes:
<ul>
   <li>scroller, colreorder and fixedheader: all supported plugins can now be enabled thanks to the ext table attribute (lien)</li>
   <li>cdn: the asset provisionning is now handled by Dandelion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title">Thymeleaf dialect</h3>
<p>As for the JSP taglib, there was some changes in the Thymeleaf dialect.
<p>
   Renamed attributes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>dt:filter => dt:filterable</li>
   <li>dt:sort => dt:sortable</li>
   <li>dt:paginate => dt:pageable</li>
   <li>dt:sortInit => dt:sortInitDirection</li>
</ul>

   <li>cdn: the asset provisionning is now handled by Dandelion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title">Configuration properties</h3>
<p>
   All Dandelion modules now uses a unified system for loading configuration. As a consequence, each
   file must be in its place. 
</p>
<p>
   For Dandelion, the <code>dandelion.properties</code> must locate under the <code>/dandelion</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
   For Dandelion-Datatables, all *.properties files must now locate under the
   <code>/dandelion/datatables</code>
   directory. Apart from that, the configuration loading strategy (lien) remains applyable.
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, some properties have changed. Please see the reference for an exhaustive list of all available configuration properties. (lien)
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Using plugins and export with Thymeleaf</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Most of attributesAll export attributes has been moved from the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag to the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> tag.</li>
   <li>The value of some attributes don't require to be surrounded by single quotes anymore. See the explanations <a href="/faq/#thymeleafquote">here</a>.</li>
   
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title">Servlet2 extra</h3>
<p>The required Servlet API version has been downgraded to 2.x in the v0.10.0. We directly
   integrated the Servlet 2.x-compatible classes into Dandelion-Datatables' core. As a consequence, the Servlet2 extra has been removed.</p>
