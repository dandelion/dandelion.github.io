### Architecture :: Integrating with Dandelion

<br />
The integration with [Dandelion (core)](/dandelion) is planned for the v0.10.0 or v0.11.0 release of **Dandelion-Datatables**.

From this release, you'll be able to use [Dandelion-Datatables](/datatables) inside your Dandelion [asset stack](/dandelion/features/assets/).
