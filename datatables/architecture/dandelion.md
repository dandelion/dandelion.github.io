### Architecture :: Integrating with Dandelion

<br />
The integration with [Dandelion (core)](/dandelion) is planned for the [v0.9.0 release of **Dandelion-Datatables**](https://github.com/dandelion/issues/issues?milestone=3&state=open).

From this release, you'll be able to use Dandelion-Datatables inside your Dandelion asset stack.
