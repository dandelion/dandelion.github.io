<h2 class="page-title">Overview of the extension mechanism</h2>

<p>Since the earliest version of Dandelion-Datatables, we've been trying to develop the framework in
   a modular manner. That's why if you dig into the source code, you'll see lots of already existing
   extensions as the {% javadoc dt datatables-core AjaxFeature %}, the {% javadoc dt datatables-core ServerSideFeature %}, 
   or the {% javadoc dt datatables-core Bootstrap2Theme %}, ...</p>
<p>
   Starting from the v0.9.0, you can now write your own extensions, providing a powerful mechanism
   to customize your tables.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiae">What is an extension?</h3>
<p>
   Any extension will generally fall into one of three categories:
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Theme</strong>: extension used to theme a table (e.g. {% javadoc dt datatables-core Bootstrap2Theme %})</li>
      <li><strong>Plugin</strong>: extension used to encapsulate a DataTables' native plugin (e.g. {% javadoc dt datatables-core ScrollerPlugin %})</li>
      <li><strong>Feature</strong>: all other extensions (e.g. {% javadoc dt datatables-core ServerSideFeature %})</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   But generally speaking, we'll call it simply <i>extension</i>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wycdwe">What you can do with extensions</h3>

<h4>Access the DataTables' parameters</h4>
<p>
   One of the key features of Dandelion-Datatables is that it generates all the needed DataTables
   parameters for you, depending on how you used the JSP taglib or the Thymeleaf dialect.
</p>
<p>
   By using the extension mechanism, you can easily modify these parameters:
   <ul>
      <li>by adding or replacing any of them</li>
      <li>by adding a DataTable <a href="/datatables/features/advanced/using-callbacks.html">callback</a></li>
      <li>by chaining another Javascript call (useful for extra, such as (lien))</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h4>Access the Dandelion scopes</h4>
<p>
   Often the extension needs some extra Javascript code, e.g. a library.
</p>
<p>
   The concept of scope (lien) introduced in the v0.10.0 is also accessible from any extension.
   Thus, you can benefit from the powerful asset system of Dandelion and play with scopes inside your extension.
</p>

<h4>Access the whole generated Javascript file</h4>
<p>
   Any Javascript code can be inserted in the generated Javascript file. Useful if you need for
   example to set a variable before the DataTables initialization.
</p>

<h4>Access the HTML table</h4>
<p>
   The HTML table can be easily accessed, as well as the columns and all other nested tags.
</p>

<br />
<p>
   To summarize, you have here a powerful mechanism in situations where all ready-to-use extensions don't fit your needs.
