<h2 class="page-title">Going further with extensions...</h2>

<h3 class="section-title">Preamble</h3>
<p>
   The <a href="overview.html">extension mechanism</a> is already powerful. But coupled with other features, you can go one step further...
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="cyof">Creating your own feature</h3>
<p>
   Since the v0.9.0, the support for dynamic attributes has been added in the {% refjsp dt table %}
   and {% refjsp dt column %} JSP tags. With Thymeleaf, you can actually already make use of the
   <code>data-*</code>
   HTML5-friendly attributes.
