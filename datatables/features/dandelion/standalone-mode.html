<p>
   Since the v0.10.0, Dandelion-Datatables uses
   <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion Core</a> to handle assets of your
   application. For some reasons, you may wish to disable the dependency
   mechanism and manage all client-side dependencies by yourself. Let's see how.
</p>

<p>
   Actually, it's as simple as adding the <a href="/datatables/docs/ref/configuration/#main.standalone"></a> property in your
   <a
      href="/datatables/features/configuration/configuration-overloading.html">configuration
      file</a>.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
main.standalone=true
</pre>
<p>
   As soon as your declare the above property, Dandelion-Datatables will
   use the exclusion mechanism of
   <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion Core</a> for all the assets contained in the <a
      href="/datatables/docs/ref/bundles/">vendor bundles</a> but <i>datatables</i>.
</p>
<p>
   In this way, you can still use Dandelion-Datatables with your legacy assets.
