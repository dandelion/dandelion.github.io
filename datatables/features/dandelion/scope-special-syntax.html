   But you can of course override it in multiple ways:
   <ul>
      <li>First, you can add a file called <i>datatables.properties</i> at the root of the classpath, allowing you to redefine every property you need. Your custom global configuration will then be
         merged with the default one.
      </li>
      <li>Or you can locally override properties using the {% refjsp dt prop %} JSP tag. Just define the property's name and value.</li>
   </ul>
</p>
