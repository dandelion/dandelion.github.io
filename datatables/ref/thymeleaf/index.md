<h3>Thymeleaf reference</h3>
<hr />

[Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org) is a recent and very promising template engine that can completely substitute JSP in your applications.

Since v0.8.1, you can use <strong>Dandelion-DataTables</strong> with Thymeleaf thanks to the <i>DatatablesDialect</i>. At the moment, not all options are supported but more will be added over the time!

You can find below the dialect reference, sorted by HTML tags :

 * [&lt;table> attributes](tmltable.html)
 * [&lt;thead> attributes](tmlthead.html)
 * [&lt;th> attributes](tmlth.html)
