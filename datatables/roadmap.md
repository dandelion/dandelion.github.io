<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr />

This is not a formal roadmap, more a priority list which evolves with time.

<br />
<h4>High priority</h4>

 * Better integration with Thymeleaf

 * Extension points for AbstractExtension
 
 * Add content assist in Eclipse for the Thymeleaf dialect and all enumerated types of the JSP taglib
 
 * Spring Data REST integration (for server-side processing)
 
 * Tests!

<br />
<h4>Medium priority</h4>

 * Websocket support for continuously-updating table
 
 * Export the current (paginated / sorted) entries

 * [TableTools](http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/) plugin integration

<br />
<h4>Low priority</h4>

 * Table live editing

<br />
<h4>Any idea ?</h4>
