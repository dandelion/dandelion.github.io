<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr />

This is not a formal roadmap, more a priority list which evolves with time.

<br />
<h4>Dandelion</h4>

We've planned to make the connection between **Dandelion-Datatables** and **Dandelion** (core module) in the v0.9.0. Meanwhile, **Dandelion-Datatables** will stay on the v0.8.x branch.

The v1.0.0 will be of course the first officially stable release.

<br />
<h4>High priority</h4>

 * Add the export feature using AJAX sources
 * Better i18n support
 * Extension points for AbstractExtension
 * Add content assist in Eclipse for the Thymeleaf dialect and all enumerated types of the JSP taglib 
 
 
<br />
<h4>Medium priority</h4>

 * Websocket support for continuously-updating table
 * Export the current (paginated / sorted) entries
 * [TableTools](http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/) plugin integration
 * Spring Data REST integration (for server-side processing)

<br />
<h4>Low priority</h4>

 * Table live editing

<br />
<h4>Any idea ?</h4>
