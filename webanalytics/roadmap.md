<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr />

This is not a formal roadmap, more a priority list which evolves with time.

<br />
<h4>High priority</h4>

 * Add more configuration points for the provider and the token
 * Add more configuration points for the Built-in providers


<br />
<h4>Medium priority</h4>

 * Add a extension point to manage configuration on a buit-in or specific provider

<br />
<h4>Any idea ?</h4>
