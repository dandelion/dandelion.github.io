               <p>
                  Dandelion is an after-dinner project which comes first from <a
                     href="http://tduchateau.github.com/DataTables-taglib/">Datatables-taglib</a>, a first attempt to write a JSP taglib allowing to generate HTML tables improved by <a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Then the project evolved to become <a href="https://github.com/datatables4j">DataTables4j</a>, a second attempt to write a more featured library, but this time almost capable of
                  competing with <a href="http://www.displaytag.org/">Displaytag</a>, the reference for displaying HTML tables in Java-based web applications.
               </p>
               <p> 
                  The project has continued to evolve but with the a recurring observation: the web asset management (js, css, ...) can often become a hell of a job in web apps. That's why we took those 3 decisions:
                  <ul>
                     <li>try to create something capable of simplifying the web asset management - what a programme! :-)</li>
                     <li>enlarge the area, from HTML tables to other components or even to wider issues still related to the web environment, like web analytics</li>
                     <li>find a new name for the project, something's more generic, allowing us to start developing a real framework. After lengthy and not always constructive discussions, we found it: <strong>Dandelion</strong> :-)</li>                  
                  </ul>

               <p>
                  You have several options:
               </p>

                  <li>you can follow us on <a href="{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter</a></li>

               <h3 id="productionready" class="section-title">Is it stable? Can it be considered production-ready?</h3>
               <p>
                  Not yet. You may consider Dandelion (and any of its component) as production-ready as soon as a v1.0.0 is released.

            <section>
               <h3 id="snapshot" class="section-title">How to use a SNAPSHOT version of a Dandelion module?</h3>
               <p>
                  Whichever module is being developed, a <strong>snapshot release</strong> is always built as soon as a commit is pushed in its GitHub repository. You can of course use it, for testing purposes. It will allow you to try new features or specific bug fixes.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In order to use snapshot releases, you need to add the Sonatype OSS Snapshots repository in your Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file, as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;repositories>
   &lt;repository>
      &lt;id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots&lt;/id>
      &lt;name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots&lt;/name>
      &lt;url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots&lt;/url>
      &lt;snapshots>
         &lt;enabled>true&lt;/enabled>
      &lt;/snapshots>
   &lt;/repository>
&lt;/repositories></pre>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Also, you will have to update the dependencies. If the version under development is the 0.9.0, you will have to modify the versions like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;dependencies>
   ...
   &lt;dependency>
      &lt;groupId>com.github.dandelion&lt;/groupId>
      &lt;artifactId>datatables-jsp&lt;/artifactId>
      &lt;version>0.9.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version>
   &lt;/dependency>         
   &lt;dependency>
      &lt;groupId>com.github.dandelion&lt;/groupId>
      &lt;artifactId>datatables-servlet2&lt;/artifactId>
      &lt;version>0.9.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version>
   &lt;/dependency>
   ...
&lt;/dependencies></pre>
               </p>

            <section>
               <h3 id="domajax" class="section-title">Can I use the exact same configuration with DOM and AJAX sources?</h3>
               <p>
                  No you can't. With DOM sources (i.e. when you set some
                  collection in the page scope), the creation of the
                  <code>table</code>
                  HTML tag and all its content is entirely managed by
                  Dandelion-Datatables.
               </p>
               <p>Whereas when using AJAX sources, Dandelion-Datatables
                  is limited to the thead section of the table. The
                  creation of the tbody section of the table is
                  delegated to DataTables. 
               </p>
               <p>All the tag references display a "Data source
                  compatibility" column, helping you to choose the right
                  attribute, depending on the data source you use.</p>
