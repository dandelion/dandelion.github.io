Dandelion-Core has been released in v1.1.1. This is a maintenance version, mainly focused on the http://bower.io/[Bower] integration, and should work as a drop-in replacement for 1.1.x versions. 

By the way, thanks to https://github.com/wmh[Hunter Wu] from Taiwan for his contributions!

The full change logs is available link:/components/core/1.1.1/changelog/[here].

Happy coding!
