<p>After several months of hibernation, I'm happy to announce the...
</p>
<div>
   <img style="float:right; padding-bottom:20px;" src="/assets/images/blog/gif_dance_now.gif" />
   <h1 style="padding-top: 70px;">Release of Dandelion v0.10.0!</h1>
</div>

<h3 class="section-title" style="clear:both;">Past and present</h3>
<p>
   Until this release, <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> and
   <a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> were evolving
   separatly. It began about 2 years ago with
   <i>Datatables4j</i>, aimed at easing the integration of
   the <a
      href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables jQuery plugin</a> in
   JVM-based web applications. But with a recurring observation: the web
   resources management can sometimes become a hell of a job. Especially
   with DataTables, however complete, which sometimes requires extra
   resources and can become hard to configure. Also with about 2
   tons of new librairies released every month (approximate number).
</p>
<p>
   That's why <a href="https://twitter.com/rlespinasse">Romain</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/tduchateau">I</a>, as good global
   citizens, decided to find something to
   address this issue.
</p>
<p>
   After several prototypes based on a perfect use case - <i>Datatables4j</i>
   - <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion</a> was born. We continued to
   improve it independently during some months and finally, despite
   several sudden new developments which held up the release for nearly
   four months, we ended up releasing a whole new version of <a
      href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> and connecting <a
      href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> to <a
      href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> in the same time. <img
      src="/assets/images/blog/rockout.png" />
</p>
<p>This is of course extremely satisfying for us. This is all the
   more satisfying because Dandelion is, since the beginning, an
   after-dinner project.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Versioning</h3>
<p>
   Starting from the v0.10.0, we have aligned
   <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> and <a
      href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> versions. As for
   example with <a
      href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a>, you won't get a
   headache studying which version of the component C2 is compatible
   with the component C1. Every artifact is now released under the same
   version number.
</p>
<p>
   Note however that we have left out <a href="/webanalytics">Dandelion-Webanalytics</a>,
   which is still incubating.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Dandelion-Datatables</h3>
<p>
   Much has changed! Below is an extract from the <a
      href="/datatables/releases/0.10.0/">full change log</a>.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>All extension mechanism has been refreshed and improved
      thanks to the Dandelion-Core features</li>
   <li>Performance increased by refactoring the internal
      configuration system</li>
   <li>New way to generate the Javascript code and possibility to
      plug in a custom generator</li>
   <li>Improved filtering with AJAX sources: <a href="/datatables/features/basics/filtering/delayed-filtering.html">delayed filtering</a>,
      <a href="/datatables/features/ajax/reloading-data.html">data reloading</a>, ...</li>
   <li>New <a href="/datatables/features/styling/">themes and theme options</a> available: <a
      href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a>,
      BS2/BS3-Responsive option, based on <a
      href="https://github.com/Comanche/datatables-responsive">datatables-responsive</a> by <a
      href="https://github.com/Comanche">Comanche</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
   For those who are already using Dandelion-Datatables, note that a
   migration guide is <a
      href="/datatables/docs/migration/from-0.9.x-to-0.10.x.html">available
      here</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Dandelion-Core</h3>
<p>
   <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> has became the fundation of
   the <a href="/">Dandelion Framework</a>. In this regard:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>the previous version (0.2.1) has been fully refactored and
      now offers plenty of new features</li>
   <li><a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> is now fully
      integrated with <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a>, as
      mentioned above. The same will apply for <a href="/roadmap">future
         components</a></li>
   <li>and the cool thing is that you can also use <a
      href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> as a standalone library!
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, much remains to be done. But it is something like that
   popular saying: "done is better than perfect".</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look at:</p>
<ul>
   <li>the <a href="/dandelion">brand new documentation</a></li>
   <li>the <a href="/dandelion/releases/0.10.0/">full change
         log</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title">Sample applications</h3>
<p>
   Looots of sample applications have been added to the <a
      href="https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion-samples">dedicated
      repository</a>:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Under the <code>/dandelion</code> folder, you will find some
      sample apps demonstrating the key features of <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a>.
      And others will soon follow.
   </li>
   <li>Under <code>/datatables</code>, plenty of new sample apps
      demonstrating each of the Dandelion-Datatables' features.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
   Note that we have also made a new <a
      href="https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion-samples/tree/master/dandelion/dandelion-petclinic">Dandelion-enabled
      version of the Spring PetClinic sample application</a> in which are
   integrated both Dandelion-Core and Dandelion-Datatables. A series of
   blog posts will be soon published in this regard.
</p>
<p>Finally, the official Spring PetClinic sample application will be
   soon updated with this new version.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Issue tracker and workflow automation</h3>
<p>We previously used a single Github repository for all issues but
   it turned out to be less practical than we initially thought. That's
   why each repository uses now its own issue tracker (the Github one).
   Again, sorry for the notification bombing during the migration. :-/</p>
<p>
   And to add some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sugar</span>
   fun to the issue management, all repositories are now
   plugged in <a href="https://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a>. We will
   progressively migrate issues/ideas from <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>
   to <a href="https://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a>, hoping that this will
   bring more interaction and transparency to the issue workflow. Of
   course, you can still use the native Github issue tracker, it's
   really up to you.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Documentation</h3>
<p>Of course, all <a href="/">documentation</a> has been refreshed to reflect
   the last changes, both in <a href="/dandelion">Dandelion-Core</a> and
   <a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a>.</p>
<p>But there is one other point it's worth noting: you can now
   contribute to the documentation.</p>
<p>
   The doc site is now plugged in <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>.
   <a href="https://github.com/prose/prose">Prose</a> is an awesome tool
   for editing sites hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
   You don't even need to know what a pull request means, this is done
   automatically once you have submitted your changes. Long story short,
   don't hesitate to improve the documentation!
</p>
