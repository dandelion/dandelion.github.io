**Dandelion-Datatables v0.8.10 has been released in Maven Central.**

The new release contains lots of new features, for both JSP and Thymeleaf. See the [changelog](/datatables/changelog.html) for more details. 

The other thing to mention is that we tried to integrate the awesome new design made by [Gianni Polito](/acknowledgments.html). For now, only [Dandelion-Datatables](/datatables) has been re-designed. Feel free to share any feedback in the forum! 

_For more information, see the dandelion-datatables' [changelog](/datatables/changelog.html)_

_As usual, there is a [forum discussion](http://dandelion-forum.48353.n6.nabble.com/Dandelion-Datatables-v0-8-10-has-been-released-td297.html) for this blog post. As usual, your thoughts and feedback are very welcome. :-)_
