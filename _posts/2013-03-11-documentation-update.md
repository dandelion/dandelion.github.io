#### Fresh documentation available!

The new documentation has been published! From now, we'll use [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for the whole documentation generation and publication process.

All the informations are now centralized in [http://dandelion.github.com](http://dandelion.github.com) (documentation, blog, ...).
We tried to make the site as user friendly as possible.

 * [http://dandelion.github.com/datatables](http://dandelion.github.com/datatables) : for the Dandelion-DataTables' documentation
 * [http://dandelion.github.com/dandelion](http://dandelion.github.com/dandelion) : for the Dandelion core documentation
 * [http://dandelion.github.com/webanalytics](http://dandelion.github.com/webanalytics) : for the Dandelion-webAnalytics' documentation

Technically speaking, we now use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to generate the site and the famous [Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) to have a clear and responsive site.


**We hope that this huge refreshment will make the documentation much user friendly and informative.**
