I'm happy to announce the release of Dandelion v0.10.1.

Even if it's mainly a bugfixing version, this release stabilizes the basis for the next important release: the v0.11.0 https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.11.0[Dandelion] / https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion-datatables/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.11.0[Dandelion-Datatables])
