**Dandelion-Datatables v0.8.7 has been released in Maven Central.**

The important thing to mention for this new release is that it embeds the first pull-request!! Thanks to [Pavel Janecka](https://github.com/Sorceror), you can now add a Javascript rendering function in AJAX-populated tables. Many thanks to him!

For the rest, the 0.8.7 contains mainly bugfixes.
