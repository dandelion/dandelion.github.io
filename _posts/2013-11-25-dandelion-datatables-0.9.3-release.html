<p>
   <strong>Dandelion-Datatables v0.9.3 has been released!</strong>
</p>

<br />
<p>
   The main thing in this release is the support for <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> 2.1.x. You can now peacefully use Dandelion-Datatables in your Thymeleaf templates. :-)
</p>
<p>
   Some other improvements have also been shipped.
</p>
<p>
   I take this opportunity to thank the new <a href="/team">contributors</a>: <strong>Bill Gorder</strong>, <strong>David Cervera PÃ©rez</strong> and <strong>Serdyn du Toit</strong>. Many thanks to them for their help! 
</p>
