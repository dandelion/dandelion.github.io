== Changelog of {{ site.data.components[page.component].name }} 0.8.6

=== Core

* New release management: now, all JARs (core and extras) have the same version number. This will be much clearer and simpler for both developers and users
* New cache system: a huge performance issue has been raised by https://github.com/jdubois[Julien Dubois] during his stress test of the Spring-petclinic app. It has been fixed setting up a basic cache system (a static Map at the moment) that stores the generated web resources (js, css) per request URI and per table DOM id. This way, the DataTables configuration (and other needed assets) are generated only once and then are stored in the AssetCache. So no need to use the ServletContext any longer, which was decreasing performance.

=== JSP implementation

* New `searchable` column attribute, allowing to exclude a column from searching

=== Thymeleaf implementation

* New `dt:searchable` th attribute, allowing to exclude a column from searching
