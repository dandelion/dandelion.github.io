=== Core

* Added support for Java-based i18n (resource bundle) and provided ready-to-use integration with JSTL and Spring. Also added and extension point allowing to plug any other locale and message resolvers
* Added support for global configuration and configuration groups, allowing:
** to join together in one properties file a configuration which will be applied on all tables in the application
** to put together table configurations inside multiple groups that can be then activated locally using tag attributes
** you also plug your own configuration loader
* Added an extension point for custom extensions (feature, plugin, theme) scanned at runtime
* Improved sorting features: you can now apply sorting functions on columns: currency, natural sort, filesize, "anti-the",...
* Improved filtering features
** Filtering elements can be configured in different locations: after the thead, before the thead, in the tfoot or in an external form
** Dandelion-Datatables now uses its own column filter plugin
* Added support for AJAX exports using a new fluent API for building table from a data source
* Improved DOM-based exports
* Improved CDN support: itâ€™s now fully configurable through properties (enablement, css link, js link)
* Added support for horizontal scrolling
* Reduced needed third-party libraries (commons-lang removed)
* Added plenty of comments and logs, removed plenty of dead code

=== JSP implementation

* Added support for dynamic attributes in `<datatables:table>` and `<datatables:column>` tags, allowing for example to use any of the native HTML table attributes like border
* Improved JSP tags composition, allowing e.g. to nest Dandelion-Datatables and JSTL tags.
* Added support for runtime expressions in all attributes of the JSP taglib
* Removed the `labels` table attribute in favour of full Java-based i18n
* New `sortType` column attribute, allowing you to apply different sorting function in columns 
* New `url` export attribute, allowing you to export a table using a custom URL.
* New `method` export attribute, allowing you make the call to the export URL using the HTTP method you set
* New `filterPlaceholder` table attribute, allowing you change the default filtering placeholder (tfoot) for all 
* New `ext` table attribute, allowing you activate multiple custom extensions

=== Thymeleaf implementation

* `<script>` and `<link>` generation is now optimized using Thymeleaf
* Moved all previous export attributes from the `<tbody>` tag to the `<thead>` tag
* Removed the `dt:labels` table attribute in favour of full Java-based i18n
* New `dt:sortType %} th attribute, allowing you to apply different sorting function in columns
* New `dt:csv:url`, `dt:xml:url`, `dt:pdf:url`, `dt:xls:url` and `dt:xlsx:url` thead attributes, allowing you to export a table using a custom URL
* New `dt:csv:method`, `dt:xml:method`, `dt:pdf:method`, `dt:xls:method` and `dt:xlsx:method` thead attributes, allowing you make the call to the export URL using the HTTP method you set
* New `dt:ext` table attribute, allowing you activate multiple custom extensions
</ul>

=== Spring3 extra

* Spring dependencies are now marked as provided
* Added ready-to-use `SpringLocaleResolver` and `SpringMessageResolver` to connect Dandelion-Datatables to the Spring i18n mechanism
* Added `DatatablesCriteriasMethodArgumentResolver` allowing you to resolve a method argument of type `DatatablesCriterias` annotated with `DatatablesParams` (compatible with Spring 3.1+)

=== Export iText extra

* The PdfExport now implements the new `DatatablesExport` interface
* A default title is now always added

=== Export POI extra

=== Export POI-OOXML extra

* The XlsxExport now implements the new `DatatablesExport` interface
