<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr />

This is not a formal roadmap, more a priority list which evolves with time.

<br />
<h4>High priority</h4>

 * Compression Feature on Assets Stack
 * Aggregation Feature on Assets Stack

<br />
<h4>Medium priority</h4>

 *  Manage multiple parents for a scope in Assets Stack
 *  Manage Pre-compiled assets in Assets Stack (Less, ...)

<br />
<h4>Low priority</h4>

 *  Add more configuration points for the developer mode
 *  Tools to visualize your Assets Stack
 *  Generate a assets stack from your assets package manager (bower, yeoman, ...)

<br />
<h4>Any idea ?</h4>
