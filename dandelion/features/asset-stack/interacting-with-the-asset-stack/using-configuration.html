<h2 class="page-title">Using configuration</h2>

<p>
   You can also use the <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration/">configuration
      properties</a> to interact with the asset stack.
</p>
<p>
   Note that all following properties have a global impact on the asset stack, i.e. in all your application.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="mb">Activate bundles permanently</h3>
<p>
   Among all available properties, one can be use to activate a bundle permanently. It can be handy
   for example when you need to load a CSS file everywhere in your application.
</p>
<p>
   For this purpose, just define the
   <code>bundles.include</code>
   in your <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration">dandelion.properties</a> file.
</p>
<p>
   For example, assuming your <code>dandelion.properties</code> file contains the following configuration:
<pre class="prettyprint">
bundles.include=bootstrap2
</pre>
   The
   <code>bootstrap2</code>
   bundle will be loaded into the asset stack permanently. As a consequence, all assets defined in this
   bundle will be loaded in all pages.
</p>
