<h2 class="page-title">Bundle reloading</h2>
<p>
   During project development, you may need to add new or change existing
   <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">asset
      bundles</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Dandelion doesn't support automatic bundle reloading yet. For now, you have to do it manually.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ryab">Reloading your asset bundles</h3>
<p>
   To reload your <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">asset
      bundles</a>, you just need to append a new
   <code>reloadBundles</code>
   request parameter to the current URL.
</p>
<p>
   For example, if you're currently browsing the following URL:
   <code>http://localhost/context/foo</code>
   , just modify the URL as follows:
   <code>http://localhost/context/foo?reloadBundles</code>
   . As a consequence, Dandelion will re-initialize your
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle
      graph</a>.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-warn">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-warning fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; It is
   worth noting that bundle reloading is only accessible in <i>development mode</i>.
