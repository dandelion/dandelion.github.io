<p>
   During project development, Dandelion applies a particular caching policy that prevents browsers to cache your assets.
</p>
<p>
   This is done thanks to the following HTTP headers applied on each request that serves an asset:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>Cache-Control</code>, set to <code>no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate</code></li>
   <li><code>Pragma</code>, set to <code>no-cache</code></li>
   <li><code>Expires</code>, set to 0</li>
</ul>
