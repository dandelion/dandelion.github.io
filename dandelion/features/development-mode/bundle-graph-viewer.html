<h2 class="page-title">Bundle graph viewer</h2>
<p>
   Dandelion ships a nice development tool: the <i>bundle
      graph viewer</i> which will help you to visualize how Dandelion deals with your assets.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="atbgv">Accessing the bundle graph viewer</h3>
<p>
   To access the <i>bundle graph viewer</i>, you just need to append a new
   <code>showGraph</code>
   request parameter to the current URL.
</p>
<p>
   For example, if you're currently browsing the following URL:
   <code>http://localhost/context/foo</code>
   , just modify the URL as follows:
   <code>http://localhost/context/foo?showGraph</code>
   . As a consequence, Dandelion will override the response with the
   <i>bundle graph viewer</i>.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-warn">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-warning fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; It is
   worth noting that the <i>bundle
      graph viewer</i> is only accessible when the
   <i>development mode</i> is enabled.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="bgve">Example</h3>
<p>
   For example, while running the <a href="https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion-samples/tree/master/datatables/datatables-jsp-ajax">datatables-jsp-ajax
      sample application</a> at the following URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-ajax/server-side/enabling-server-side-processing</code> , you can
   access the
   <i>bundle graph viewer</i> at <code>http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-ajax/server-side/enabling-server-side-processing?showGraph</code>.
</p>
<p>
   As a result, you'll see in your browser:
</p>
<p>
   <img src="/assets/images/dandelion/development-mode-01.png" style="border: 1px dashed black;" />
</p>
<p>
   This viewer allows you to:   
</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Visualize the current request graph of bundles</strong>. Note that you can mouse
      over the graph to see how Dandelion will inject into the current page all the assets contained
      in the active bundles.</li>
   <li><strong>Visualize the full application graph</strong>, with no other interaction.</li>
   <li>Go back to app by clicking the <i>Back to app</i> button at right.
   </li>
</ul>
