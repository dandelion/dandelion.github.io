<h2 class="page-title">Production mode</h2>

<p>
   Dandelion provides two modes: <i>development</i> and <i>production</i>. We'll see here what it is
   hiding behind the <i>development mode</i>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="itdm">Introducing the developement mode</h3>
<p>
   Dandelion has been designed to make the web development simpler. This is why the framework ships
   a
   <i>development mode</i> which helps developers making great apps faster thanks to the following features:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Asset reloading thanks to specific HTTP cache headers. Read more <a href="">here</a>.
      (TODO lien)
   </li>
   <li>A bundle graph viewer, allowing you to visualize on runtime how Dandelion will manage
      your assets. Read more <a href="">here</a>. (TODO lien)
   </li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>
   However, much work remains to be done. For example the bundle full reloading is not
   supported yet, which means each time you modify a
   <a href="">bundle</a> (TODO lien), you have to restart your server.
</p>

<p>
   Feel free to browse the opposite menu to read more about the <i>development mode</i>.
