<h2 class="page-title">Introducing asset caching</h2>

<p>
   You may have seen in the section about <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-locators/introducing-asset-locators.html">asset
      locators</a> that some of them require caching. Actually caching
   operates at several levels that we'll see in this section.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ac">Asset caching</h3>
<p>
   As soon as a page is requested, Dandelion reads your
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle
      graph</a>, grabs all necessary assets and apply asset processors
   on them.
</p>
<p>
   This is where the first caching pass occurs: as soon as an asset is
   fetched, using its associated locator, the content can be stored in
   the configured cache system, but under certain condition.
</p>
<h4>Production mode</h4>
<p>
   In <a href="/dandelion/features/production-mode/">production
      mode</a>, the content of assets is always cached after
   all enabled processors have processed the assets. This way, assets
   processing is done only once.
</p>
<h4>Development mode</h4>
<p>
   In <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/">development
      mode</a>, actually it depends on the locator used to fetch the asset.
</p>
<p>
   Basically, if Dandelion can render the asset directly from its
   source (e.g. with assets coming from the current webapp, or from a
   CDN), the asset won't be cached.
</p>
<p>
   However if the asset comes, for example, from a JAR, Dandelion
   will generate direct link if your servlet container allows it
   (Servlet API >3.0). If not, the asset will be cached.
</p>

<h4>Cache key</h4>
<p>
   Each asset that must be cached has an associated cache key defined as follows:
</p>
<p>
   <strong>[SHA1_generated_from_the_current_URL]/[asset_name]-[asset_version].[asset_type]</strong>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="rc">Request caching</h3>
<p>
   The second pass of caching occurs as soon as all assets requested by
   a page are fetched and processed.
</p>
<p>
   At this moment, Dandelion will store the association
      between the request and all the corresponding assets into the
   configured cache system.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4>Cache key</h4>
<p>
   These assets are stored under a simple cache key which corresponds to
   the current request's URI with potential request parameters appended.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="bics">Built-in cache system</h3>
<p>
   By default, Dandelion uses a memory-based cache with a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">LRU</a>
   policy.
</p>
<p>
   Note that an extra has been developed for <a
      href="http://ehcache.org/">Ehcache</a>. See more <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-caching/built-in-cache-systems/">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="pyocs">Plugging-in your own cache system</h3>
<p>
   As all other parts of the framework, Dandelion provides an extension point allowing you to
   plug-in your own cache system. Read more
