   Dandelion provides some processors intended to be applied on assets. This section introduces
   major concepts around these processors.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="def">Definition</h3>
<p>
   An <i>asset processor</i> (or <i>processor</i> to simplify the language) is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A processor key, used as an identifier</li>
   <li>A type of asset to process, such as <i>js</i> or <i>css</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
   All processors are currently used to minify assets thereby improving load times.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
   In upcoming releases, more processors will be provided, allowing to process more CSS and JavaScript languages such as
   <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Dandelion already provides some <a href="/built-in">built-in
      processors</a> which are configured by default when the
   <a href="/dandelion/features/production-mode">production mode</a> (TODO) is enabled. Note that
   when the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/development-mode">development mode</a> is enabled, the
   <a href="">minification</a> (TODO lien) configuration property is disabled, and thus no processor
   is applied.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="sbl">Built-in cache system</h3>
<p>
   By default, Dandelion uses 
</p>
<h3 class="section-title" id="ac">Configuring asset processors</h3>
<p>
   Asset processors are configured through the <a
      href="">asset.processors</a> (TODO) configuration property. You just need to define a
   comma-separated list of processor keys to enable the corresponding processors.
</p>
<p>
   For example, the default value is
   <code>cssurlrewriting,jsmin,cssmin</code>
   . This means that by default, the processors behing these keys will be applied sequentially on
   all asset, depending on their compatible asset type(s).
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ac">Enabling asset processing</h3>
<p>
   By default, no asset is processed, because the
   <a href="">minification</a> (TODO) configuration property is set to
   <code>false</code>
   (see the <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/default-configuration.html">default
      configuration</a>).
</p>
<p>
   You can activate asset processing by turning the above configuration property to
   <code>true</code>
   . When set to
   <code>true</code>
   , Dandelion will use the asset processors configured thanks to the
   <a href="">asset.processors</a> (TODO) configuration property as seen in the previous section.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="acns">Asset caching and naming strategy</h3>
<p>
   Once asset processing is enabled, there are two points to note:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <p>
         Asset naming: the <i>min</i> keyword is appended to the asset name, just before the extension name.
      </p>
      <p>
         For example, an asset non-minified called <code>app-1.0.0.css</code> will be called <code>app-1.0.0.min.css</code>. 
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Asset caching: it is also worth noting that all processed assets will be first cached,
         thanks to the
         <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-caching">configured cache system</a>, and then served by
         the DandelionServlet (TODO).
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title" id="pyop">Plugging-in your own processor</h3>
<p>
   As all other parts of the framework, Dandelion provides an extension point allowing you to
   plug-in your own asset processor. Read more
