<h2 class="page-title">CDN location wrapper</h2>

<h3 class="section-title" id="cdnlwu">Usage</h3>
<p>
   The CDN location wrapper must be used whenever you need to load an asset hosted by a Content Delivery Network.
</p>
<p>
   <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Location key</td>
            <td><code>cdn</code></td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Active by default</td>
            <td>no</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Corresponding value</td>
            <td>URL of the asset (protocal-relative URLs are supported)</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
</p>

<p>
   The reason why this location wrapper is not active by default is that it is only useful whenever
   the loaded asset needs to be processed, e.g. whenever minification or aggegation is enabled.
</p>
<p>
   In such cases, the CDN location wrapper will process all relative links inside CSS files before
   returning their content.
</p>
<p>
   By default during the development phase, assets are not processed and the location configured in
   the JSON definition is left untouched in the HTML sources.
