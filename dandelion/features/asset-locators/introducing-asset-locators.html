<h2 class="page-title">Introducing asset locators</h2>

<p>
   You may have noticed in the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">introduction about
      asset bundles</a> that each asset can be defined with multiple locations. This feature is
   explained in this section.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="def">Definition</h3>
<p>
   An <i>asset locator</i> (or <i>locator</i> to simplify the language) is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A location key, used as an identifier</li>
   <li>An associated location that may be processed, depending on the locator</li>
   <li>A flag indicating whether the asset should be cached or not</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ac">Asset caching</h3>
<p>
   Depending on the locator, Dandelion generates the right URL to serve the asset directly from the
   location where it lives. For example, all assets present in the webapp directory are defaultly
   served by the webapp itself. In this case, Dandelion will just process the given location by
   prepending the context path and there will be no caching.
</p>
<p>
   However, an asset stored in the classpath, for example, cannot be served directly by the webapp.
   Instead, in such a case, Dandelion grabs its content and stores it in the configured
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-caching/">cache system</a>, with a particular cache key. Later, the generated link
   pointing to this asset will be served by the {% javadoc ddl dandelion-core DandelionServlet %}, the role of which is
   to retrieve the content from the cache system and serve it.
</p>
<p>
   See the <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-caching/">asset caching</a> section for more details.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ex">Example</h3>
<p>
   Assuming the following <i>jquery</i> bundle:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "jquery",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "jquery",
      "version": "1.11.0",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js",
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   This bundle defines only one asset called
   <code>jquery</code>
   with a single location, pointing to a CDN. In this case, Dandelion will always pick up the CDN location.
</p>
<p>
   Now assume that the same asset of the same bundle is defined with more locations:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "jquery",
   "parent": "none",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "jquery",
      "version": "1.11.0",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js",
         "webapp" : "/assets/js/jquery.js"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Both
   <code>webapp</code>
   and
   <code>cdn</code>
   are used in the declaration of the
   <code>jquery</code>
   asset. In this case, Dandelion will apply a resolution strategy described below.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wialw">Locations resolution strategy</h3>
<p>
   By default, the following resolution strategy is used when multiples locations are declared:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Dandelion checks first if a <code>webjar</code> location key is
      defined. If so, the corresponding location will be selected.</li>
   <li>Otherwise, if the <code>webapp</code> location key is defined, the corresponding
      location will be selected.
   </li>
   <li>Finally, if none of the above location keys is used, Dandelion checks if a <code>cdn</code>
      location key is defined. If so, the corresponding location will be selected.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   You can of course override this behaviour by using the
   <code>asset.locations.resolution.strategy</code>
   <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration#asset.locations.resolution.strategy">configuration property</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Just change the order of selection of location keys in your configuration file.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
asset.locations.resolution.strategy=cdn,jar,webjar
</pre>

<h3 class="section-title" id="bil">Built-in locators</h3>
<p>
   Dandelion comes with a couple of built-in locators. Read more <a href="built-in">here</a>.
