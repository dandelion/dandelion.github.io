<h2 class="page-title">Introducing asset loaders</h2>

<p>
   As we saw in the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-stack/introducing-asset-scopes.html">asset stack
      introduction</a>, all scopes are stored in JSON files. This section describes how these files
   are loaded into the system.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="sal">Standard asset loader</h3>
<p>
   The DandelionAssetJsonLoader is the main loader used by default by Dandelion.
</p>
<p>
   Its role is to scan the classpath recursively, starting from the
   <code>/dandelion</code>
   folder, for files that ends with
   <code>.json</code>
   .
</p>
<p>
   All files found in the
   <code>/dandelion</code>
   folder will then be converted into an internal representation: AssetComponent (lien javadoc).
</p>

<p>
   For example, in the following <a
      href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> structure, the standard asset loader will pick up
   and load
   <code>scope1.json</code>
   ,
   <code>scope2.json</code>
   and
   <code>scope3.json</code>
   files.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
YourWebApp
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ dandelion
            |__ scope1.json
            |__ scope2.json
            |__ scope3.json 
</pre>

<h3 class="section-title" id="val">Vendor asset loader</h3>
<p>
   This is the second and last asset loader to be defaultly enabled by Dandelion.
</p>
<p>
   This loader is intended to load vendor's librairies, such as
   <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. The
   only difference with the other built-in loader is that it scans for JSON files inside the
   <code>/vendor</code>
   folder and all subfolders.
</p>
<p>
   For example, some <i>vendor scopes</i> are bundled with the dandelion-core JAR. They're all
   located under the
   <code>/vendor</code>
   folder.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
dandelion-core
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ vendor
            |__ jquery.json
            |__ jquery2.json
            |__ bootstap2.json
            |__ bootstap3.json
            |__ ... 
</pre>
<p>
   Of course, you are encouraged to follow the same practice, for a better asset organization.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
    Except the location, there is currently no difference with the standard asset loader. In upcoming
   releases however, this will allow us to easily apply a specific caching policy.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="maal">How it works with multiple active asset loaders?</h3>
<p>
   All active asset loaders are mutually exclusive. It means that a folder or subfolder will never
   be scanned twice.
</p>
<p>
   This rule ensures maximum consistency with the loaded assets.
