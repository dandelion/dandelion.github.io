<h2 class="page-title">Using the configuration properties</h2>
<p>
   Some configuration properties allow you to interact either with bundles or assets but in a
   wider scope than the request.</p>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="iebp">Include/exclude bundles permanently</h3>
<p>
   Sometimes you need to load some CSS files everywhere in your application.
</p>
<p>
   For this purpose, just define the
   <code>bundle.includes</code>
   property in your <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration">dandelion.properties</a> file and
   set all the bundle names you wish to include.
</p>
<p>
   As a consequence, these bundles will be loaded in every request.
</p>
<p>
   And for some reason, if you need to do the opposite, you can exclude bundles from the
   application by using the
   <code>bundle.excludes</code>
   property.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ieap">Include/exclude assets permanently</h3>
<p>
   Similarly you can permanently exclude assets from the application. Two configuration properties
   are available:
   <code>asset.js.excludes</code>
   and
   <code>asset.css.excludes</code>
   that allow to exclude JS and CSS files respectively.
</p>

<br />
<p class="alert alert-warn">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-warning fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
   Remember that interacting with the
   asset bundles using any of the above configuration properties has a global impact on the
   application.
</p>
