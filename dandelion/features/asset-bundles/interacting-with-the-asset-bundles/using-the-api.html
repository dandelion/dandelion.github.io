<h2 class="page-title">Using the API</h2>

<p>
   All <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">bundles</a> can
   also be accessed using the Dandelion API. This is the way used by current components such as
   <a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> but you could of course make use of the API for
   writing your own component or any kind of extension.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiaa">Accessing the bundle graph</h3>
<p>
   Dandelion allows you to manipulate the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle graph</a> in a
   request scope.
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Dandelion makes available a utility class called AssetRequestContext (TODO) allowing to interact
   with the Dandelion context for a given
   <code>HttpServletRequest</code>
   .
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Dandelion mainly intervene in a request scope
