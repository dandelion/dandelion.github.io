<h2 class="page-title">Using the API</h2>

<p>
   All <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">bundles</a> can
   also be accessed using the Dandelion API. This is the way used by current components such as
   <a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> but you could of course make use of the API for
   writing your own component or any kind of extension.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="atbg">Accessing the bundle graph</h3>
<p>
   Each request of your application holds the Dandelion context and thus
   gives access to Dandelion configuration, including the
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle
      graph</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The only requirement is that you have access to the <code>HttpServletRequest</code> API.
</p>
<p>
   You can then access the {% javadoc ddl dandelion-core AssetRequestContext %} object, an utility made available to allow you to interact with
   the bundle graph. See the examples below.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).addBundles(...)</code> allows you to add one or more bundles to the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeBundles(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more bundles from the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeJs(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more JavaScript assets from the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeCss(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more CSS assets from the current request</li>
   <li>...</li>
</ul>

   Remember that in <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/">development
      mode</a>, the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/bundle-graph-viewer.html">bundle
      graph viewer</a> can help you visualizing what bundles are added in
   the current request.
