<h2 class="page-title">Introducing asset bundles</h2>

<p>
   In web applications, <i>assets</i> are basically all the JavaScript and CSS files loaded in your web pages. 
   Dandelion provides a wider representation of these assets, using <i>bundles</i>.
</p>
<p>
   An <i>asset bundle</i>, or <i>bundle</i> to simplify the language, is a little more than just a
   set of assets, because it contains additional information that will be described afterwards.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="jr">Definitions</h3>
<p>
   A <strong>bundle</strong> is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A logical name (mandatory)</li>
   <li>A set of dependent bundles (optional)</li>
   <li>A ordered list of assets (mandatory)</li>
</ul> 
<p>
   And an <strong>asset</strong> is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A name (mandatory)</li>
   <li>A version (mandatory)</li>
   <li>A type, among "js" or "css" (mandatory)</li>
   <li>A location</li>
   <li>A desired position in the DOM (optional, "body" for "js", "head" for "css")</li>
   <li>Some attributes, with or without values (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title" id="jr">JSON representation</h3>
<p>
   All assets intented to be used in your web applications need to be known by the framework. For
   that, you have to create one or more bundles.</p>
<p>
   Each bundle is basically a JSON file where you will declare all assets needed in your
   application.
</p>

<h4>Basic example</h4>
<p>
   Assume we want to use jQuery in our web application. One representation could be the following:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "jquery",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "jquery",
      "version": "1.11.0",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   You will note that: 
</p>
<ul>
   <li>this bundle has no dependency</li>
   <li>the <i>jquery</i> asset is configured with the <i>cdn</i> location key. This key is mapped to
      a particular <i>asset locator</i> used by Dandelion to know the fetching strategy to use. See
      more about <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-locators">asset locators</a>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example with a dependency</h4>
<p>
   The above example of the <i>jquery</i> bundle is quite simple. But now let's consider a new bundle
   for the <a
      href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables jQuery plugin</a>. It could be written as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "datatables",
   "dependencies": [ "jquery" ],
   "assets": [{
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/jquery.dataTables.js"
      }
   }, {
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "css",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/css/jquery.dataTables.css"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   This new bundle is slighlty different. You may have noticed that the
   <i>dependencies</i> attribute is now used and indicates that the current bundle is dependent of
   the <i>jquery</i> bundle. Actually we've just told Dandelion that the DataTables jQuery plugin
   needs jQuery to work.
</p>
<p>
   Little by little, depending on the presence of dependencies, your bundles will form a kind of
   <a href="building-a-bundle-graph/">graph</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiaas">Bundle loading</h3>
<p>
   Once the JSON files written, Dandelion will load them in a particular order, using
   <i>bundle loaders</i>. See the <a href="/dandelion/features/bundle-loaders">bundle
      loaders</a> section for more information.
