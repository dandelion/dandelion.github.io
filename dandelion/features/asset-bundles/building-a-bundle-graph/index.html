<h2 class="page-title">Building a bundle graph</h2>
<p>
   We have seen in the <a href="introducing-asset-bundles.html">introduction about asset bundles</a>
   how to join assets together thanks to bundles. We'll see in this section how bundles can form a
   graph.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="bg">Bundle graph</h3>
<p>
   Once all bundles are written and the application started, Dandelion stores them internally as a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG),
   which is used to implement the relationship of dependency between bundles.
</p>
<p>
   Note that before building any graph, Dandelion applies some
   <a href="storage-rules.html">rules</a>.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
   Suppose we have the following bundles available in our application:
   <i>jquery</i>, <i>datatables</i> and <i>bootstrap2</i>:
</p>
<div class="row-fluid">
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "jquery",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "jquery",
      "version": "1.11.0",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>jquery</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "datatables",
   "dependencies": [ "jquery" ],
   "assets": [{
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/jquery.dataTables.js"
      }
   }, {
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "css",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/css/jquery.dataTables.css"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>datatables</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "bundle" : "bootstrap2",
    "dependencies" : [ "jquery" ],
    "assets": [
        {
            "name": "bootstrap2",
            "version": "2.3.2",
            "type": "js",
            "locations": {
                "cdn": "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/js/bootstrap.js"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "bootstrap2",
            "version": "2.3.2",
            "type": "css",
            "locations": {
                "cdn": "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/css/bootstrap.css"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>bootstrap2</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
</div>
<p>
   Note the use of the
   <code>dependencies</code>
   attribute in both <i>datatables</i> and <i>bootstrap2</i> bundles, which implicitly join bundles
   together into an graph.
</p>
<p>
   A graphical representation would look like:
</p>
<p class="text-center">
   <img src="/assets/images/dandelion/asset-bundles-00.png" />
</p>
<p>
   With such a representation, it becomes easy to bring back all the necessary bundles - and thus
   assets - as soon as you request one of them.
</p>
<p>
   For example, as soon as you request the <i>bootstap2</i> bundle, Dandelion will read the bundle
   graph and then return in the right order the following assets:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js</li>
   <li>//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/js/bootstrap.js</li>
   <li>//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/css/bootstrap.css</li>
</ol>

<p class="alert alert-info">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
   Note that you can visualize a dynamic bundle graph in your running application using the

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiaas">Organizing your bundles</h3>
<p>
   You are totally free to build a bundle the way you want it, e.g. by adding as many assets as you
   want. However, you should take the following considerations into account:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Reduce as much as possible the number of bundles</strong>.
      <ul>
         <li>First for performance concerns, even if the bundle loading phase is very fast.</li>
         <li>But mostly for maintenance concerns. The more bundles you have, the harder the
            maintenance will be over the time.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>Pay attention to the granularity of bundles</strong>: using only one bundle for all assets of your site would lead to bad consequences:
      <ul>
         <li>it would affect performances, especially if assets are injected into pages whereas they aren't used</li>
         <li>it would become harder and harder to share bundles among multiple pages, causing
            to create a new bundle each time you create a new page, finally leading to the consequences explained in the first point</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
