<h2 class="page-title">Overview</h2>
<p>Dandelion is a Java web framework aimed at applying - as easily
   as possible - best pratices of web developpement in JVM-based
   environments.</p>
<p>
   In this regard, Dandelion invites you to organize your web assets
   into <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/">bundles</a>. Once
   all bundles prepared, Dandelion will help you to make your web
   application more responsive:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>by injecting in an optimal way the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
      and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags: usually stylesheets at the top
      and scripts at the bottom (configurable)
   </li>
   <li>by performing typical optimizations such assets
      minification, assets merging or GZIP compression (in beta),
      whether your assets comes from the webapp, a JAR, a <a
      href="http://www.webjars.org/">WebJar</a> or a <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Dandelion is mainly based on a servlet filter which automatically
   injects assets into your HTML pages and is therefore considered as a
   runtime solution. But rather than making a long speech, take a look
   at the general overview below.
