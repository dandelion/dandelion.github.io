**Dandelion** (and all components) are tested using the great Java profiling tool [YourKit](http://www.yourkit.com/).

YourKit is kindly supporting open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler.<br/>
YourKit, LLC is the creator of innovative and intelligent tools for profiling Java and .NET applications. <br/>
Take a look at YourKit\'s leading software products: [YourKit Java Profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp) and [YourKit .NET Profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/index.jsp)

<hr />
**Dandelion-DataTables** is highly inspired by :

 * the excellent [Display tag](http://www.displaytag.org) library which I used many years in different projects
 * obviously the terrific Allan Jardine\'s [DataTables](http://datatables.net) library
 * the previous projects : [Datatables-taglib](http://tduchateau.github.com/DataTables-taglib/) and [DataTables4j](http://datatables4j.github.com/docs/)

 <hr />
Demo and documentation sites use large volumes of data generated by [generatedata](http://www.generatedata.com).
