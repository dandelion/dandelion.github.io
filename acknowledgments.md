Huge **thanks** to [Gianni Polito](https://twitter.com/giannipolito), who has made an awesome artwork on Dandelion.
Gianni is currently designer at Capgemini. He works on W8, iPhone and Android UI. He also works as a freelance.
To be short, Gianni creates interfaces that will change our tomorrow's world. But for now, he plays Angry Birds.

**Dandelion** (and all components) are tested using the great Java profiling tool [YourKit](http://www.yourkit.com/).

YourKit is kindly supporting open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler.<br/>

**Dandelion-DataTables** is highly inspired by :

 * the excellent [Display tag](http://www.displaytag.org) library which I used many years in different projects
 * obviously the terrific Allan Jardine\'s [DataTables](http://datatables.net) library
 * the previous projects : [Datatables-taglib](http://tduchateau.github.com/DataTables-taglib/) and [DataTables4j](http://datatables4j.github.com/docs/)
