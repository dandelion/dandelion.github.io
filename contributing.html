               One would think you want to improve the <span id="page-to-improve"><span> page. We suggest that you use prose.io for this. It's very simple!
            </p>
            <p>
               By clicking the link below, you will be redirected to prose.io to edit this page. Just follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Sign in with your Github account</li>
               <li>Make some changes</li>
               <li>Submit the changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Once done, it will generate a pull request in the right repository. And that's all!
            </p>
